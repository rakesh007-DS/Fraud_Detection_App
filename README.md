# Fraud_Detection_App
This project focuses on analyzing financial transaction data to detect fraudulent activities using machine learning techniques.
The dataset consists of approximately 6.3 million transactions, obtained from Kaggle: Fraud Detection Dataset.




🧠 About the Dataset

->Source: Kaggle – https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanalisiddiqui/fraud-detection-dataset

->Records: 6,362,620
Features:

->type – Transaction type (CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, TRANSFER)

->amount – Transaction amount

->oldbalanceOrg – Sender’s balance before transaction

->newbalanceOrig – Sender’s balance after transaction

->oldbalanceDest – Receiver’s balance before transaction

->newbalanceDest – Receiver’s balance after transaction

->isFraud – 1 if transaction is fraudulent, else 0

📊 Model Performance

After preprocessing and feature engineering, several algorithms were tested.
The Random Forest Classifier provided the best results.

The final model achieved:

Accuracy: 98.6%

Precision: 97.9%

Recall: 98.3%

F1-Score: 98.1%

These metrics show that the model is highly effective in detecting fraudulent transactions while maintaining strong precision and recall balance.
